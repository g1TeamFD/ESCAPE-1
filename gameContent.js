Without the annual Christmas Magic Synthesis, presents won't be able to be delivered worldwide. We've managed to gain remote access to the laboratory's systems, but we need your expertise to navigate through the security protocols and restart the Christmas Magic production.

Time is running out. Can you help save Christmas?`

The laboratory hums with magical energy as sparkling lights fill the air.

Breaking News: Dr. Frost has been found! He was accidentally locked in the candy cane testing chamber (apparently those new peppermint formulas were too delicious to resist). Thanks to your quick thinking and problem-solving skills, Christmas will proceed as planned!`
